Rules:
- If the genre primarily uses acoustic instruments (guitar, piano, drums, brass, strings), return "acoustic"
- If the genre primarily uses electronic/synthesized sounds (synths, drum machines, samplers), return "electronic"
- For hybrid genres, choose based on the dominant characteristic
- Return ONLY one word: either "acoustic" or "electronic"
